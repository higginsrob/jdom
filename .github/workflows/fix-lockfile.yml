            ## 🔧 Lock File Synchronization Fix
            
            This PR fixes the `package-lock.json` synchronization issues that were causing CI failures.
            
            ### Changes Made:
            - ✅ Regenerated `package-lock.json` from current `package.json`
            - ✅ Maintained all existing version constraints
            - ✅ Fixed npm ci compatibility issues
            
            ### Verification:
            - [x] Clean install successful
            - [x] Basic tests run
            - [x] No breaking changes to package.json
            
            ### Why This Happened:
            Lock files can get out of sync when:
            - Dependencies are installed manually without updating the lock file
            - Transitive dependencies change between npm versions
            - Lock file becomes corrupted or contains stale entries
            
            ### Next Steps:
            1. Review the changes in this PR
            2. Merge if everything looks correct
            3. CI should now pass with `npm ci`
